Hi, my name is Matt Anderson. Originally from the metro Detroit area, I currently live in Dayton, OH&mdash;the [Outdoor Adventure Capital of the Midwest](http://outdoordayton.com/)!

I work as a software engineer, primarily building scalable cloud data processing systems. Check out my [resume](/assets/Matt-Anderson-Resume.pdf) or [Github profile](https://github.com/mattbanderson) for more details.

I am currently working on personal projects for [home automation](https:/github.com/mattbanderson/home-rest-api) and [mapping traffic stress level data](https://github.com/mattbanderson/lts-dayton) for local bicyclists using Leaflet and OpenStreetMaps.

My interests include DIY projects, reading, cooking, sports, the outdoors, health and wellness, personal finance and investing, asking the naive question, and bicycling everywhere I can.

If you'd like to contact me, send me a message using the Email link in the sidebar.
