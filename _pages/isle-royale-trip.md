![Isle Royale map](https://i1.wp.com/www.liquidadventuring.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Isle-Royale-trail-map.jpg)

This could be either a 4-5 day trip, as Three Mile Campground could be skipped by going directly from Moskey Basin to Rock Harbor. 
It also leaves the option to take a zero day (i.e. no hiking day).
If possible, we will take a water taxi across Tobin Harbor to go from Rock Harbor to Lane Cove via Lookout Louise and Greenstone Trails. 
If not available, we will go to Lane Cove via Mt. Franklin trail.

## Gear

The following describes recommended gear for the trip. Tailor to your personal needs/comfort as desired.

### Big Four

* Pack
* Tent/Shelter
* Sleeping Bag/Quilt
* Sleeping Pad

### Water/Food Storage/Cookware

* [Water filter](https://www.rei.com/product/103050/sawyer-squeeze-water-filter-system) or [chemical treatment](https://www.rei.com/product/866996/aquamira-water-treatment-1-oz)

## Food

Aim for 2500-3500 calories/day. Nuts, seeds, trail mixes, dark chocolate, and oils are good calorie-dense options (i.e. offer the most calories for the least amount of weight). 

Avoid foods that are heavily hydrated or come in cans. For example, rather than a can of tuna bring the kind that comes in pouches. Instead of a can of beef stew you would want to bring dried ingredients in a freezer bag and then add water in camp or on the trail.

Pre-packaged [backpacking meals](https://www.rei.com/c/food) are also an option. 

### Breakfast 

**Coconut Chia Oatmeal** (~5 oz, 600-750 calories)

* 1/4-1/2 cup rolled oats (e.g. Quaker Oats)
* 2 tbsp chia seeds
* 2 tbsp protein powder
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 cup coconut flakes
* 2 tbsp raisins (or other dried fruit)
* 2-4 tbsp sliced almonds or walnuts
* few dashes of salt
* cinnamon to taste
* 1-2 tbsp coconut oil (if desired for extra calories)

Store ingredients in a plastic bag. Boil 10-12 oz of water. Once boiling, remove from heat and stir in ingredients. Let sit for a few minutes to absorb water and cool slightly.

This is my go-to. Can also substitute/add chocolate chips to mix up the flavor a bit. Other ideas include bagels + cream cheese or an [egg burrito](https://andrewskurka.com/breakfast-recipe-southwest-egg-burrito/) using instant eggs in a tortilla.

### Snacks 

* Trail mix 
* Dark chocolate
* Protein bars
* Beef jerky
* Pringles
* Chocolate-covered raisins
* Chocolate-covered pecans
* Oreo cookies
* Yogurt-covered pretzels

### Lunch

Lunch on the trail will probably look more like a bigger snack unless you want to pack a sub/sandwich/tortilla/etc.

**Cookie Dough** (~4 oz, 500 calories)

* 2 oz cashews
* 0.6 oz rolled oats
* 0.6 oz chocolate chips
* 0.7 oz maple syrup
* 0.1 oz vanilla extract
* Salt/cinnamon to taste

Put cashews, rolled oats, salt, and cinnamon in a food processor. Chop until fine but not so long that you make cashew butter. Blend in vanilla extract and maple syrup. If too dry, add more syrup. Mix in chocolate chips by hand. Form into 4-5 bars and store in plastic bag.

### Dinner

**Beans and Rice** (~6 oz, 650-800 calories)

* 2 oz instant beans
* 1.5 oz instant rice
* 1 oz hard cheese (cheddar, etc)
* 1 oz corn chips (e.g. Fritos)
* 0.2 oz taco seasoning
* Salt/pepper/red pepper flakes to taste
* 0.5 oz olive oil (if desired for extra calories)

Boil 10-12 oz of water on stove. Add beans, rice, and seasoning. Simmer for 60 seconds. Dice cheese and stir in. Add fritos and any additional ingredients or spices.
