# Isle Royale National Park

Isle Royale National is the only national park in the state of Michigan, and per Wikipedia, Isle Royale itself is the [4th largest lake island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_island#Naturally_occurring_lake_islands,_by_area) in the world.

It is one of the least-visited national parks, with about ~26,000 visitors in 2021. Of those 26,000, nearly 6,000 are to the park headquarters in Houghton, MI, which means only about 20,000 people actually cross Lake Superior to get to the island.

Speaking of crossing Lake Superior, Isle Royale is only accessible by boat or seaplane. The closest mainland location is Canada, about 14 miles to the north. This contributes to its remoteness and lack of visitors. The island is also home to the [longest-running predator-prey study](https://isleroyalewolf.org/overview/overview/at_a_glance.html) in the world.


# Trip Planning

Sometime in 2021, my brother-in-law mentioned taking a trip to Isle Royale was on his bucket list. That was all the nudge I needed to start planning a backpacking trip to the island.

I have a decent amount of outdoor and hiking experience, but nothing especially lengthy and never anything this remote. This was also my first time planning a group trip to the backcountry.

The [r/ultralight](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultralight) subreddit was incredibly valuable for helping to plan the right gear and food to bring. I also relied heavily on Jim DuFresne's excellent *[Isle Royale: Foot Trails and Water Routes](https://www.michigantrailmaps.com/product/isle-royale-national-park-foot-trails-water-routes/)* to plan our route.

I had initially sketched out a loop on the other end of the island starting and ending in Rock Harbor. I ultimately decided on the Feldtmann Loop to shave a day off the trip. It ended up working out well because at least one of the campgrounds my original route ended up being closed due a [fire](https://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/mt-franklin-fire-2022.htm) that occurred two weeks before our trip.

## The Crew

Four of us made the trip: me, my brother, and two friends. We drove up part of the way to the northern Lower Peninsula, stayed the night, and then drove across the Upper Peninsula to catch our seaplane from Hancock at 2 PM on Monday. 

# Day 1

We arrived about an hour early for our flight ate some lunch at the picnic tables at the dock. The seaplane flight from Hancock was very smooth, and I got to fly co-pilot on the way out. We left a few minutes early and were in Windigo by 2:30 PM. A generous pair of hikers getting ready to depart gave us a full fuel canister, so that was one less thing to worry about before hitting the trail.

We took a little bit of time checking out the Windigo visitor center and store, filling our water bottles from the potable water spigot (near the flagpole down by the dock), and completing our self-permit.

I had left open the option that if we were delayed or the weather was poor when we arrived that we could stay the first night at the Washington Creek campground next to Windigo. Havnig arrived early and With the sun shining, we all agreed we would hit the Greenstone Ridge trail and head for the Island Mine campsite (~7 miles).

We were not on the trail for more than a few minutes before we saw the first patch of ripe thimbleberries. Thimbleberry bushes can be found nearly everywhere on the island and typically ripen in August. They practically fall right off the bush and are absolutely delicious!

The trail was easy to follow but I found it surprising that there were no blazes marking the trail itself. All trail intersections were clearing marked. The trail quickly climbed up the Greenstone Ridge, but this section of the ridge is mostly tree-covered and did not offer much in the way of views. This was definitely the least interesting section of trail, as it offered little in the way of views. 

The sky gradually became more overcast and some light rain fell at various points. We kept a leisurely pace, stopping for quick breaks every 45 minutes or so. We reached the junction to head towards Island Mine camp around 7 PM and were at the campground by 7:30 PM. 

We were the second or third group into camp, but it filled up quickly after we arrived. After cooking dinner and setting up our tents, we headed down to check out the water source. Island Mine is the only campsite not on an inland lake, bay or Lake Superior, and it relies on a small stream for water. The water was mostly stagnant, but there were a few drops over rocks where flowing water could be found. The flexibilty of my CNOC Vector bladder came in very handy to position the lip of the bladder to be able to catch moving water. Aside from looking a bit sketchy, it tasted fine and no one suffered any ill effects.

# Day 2

I slept well and woke up around 7:20 AM. Today was our shortest hike at less than 4.5 miles, so we took our time making breakfast and breaking down camp. We finally hit the trail about 10:15 AM after stopping to fill our water bottles on the way out of camp. After one initial climb shortly after leaving Island Mine, the trail went gradually downhill towards Siskiwit Bay.

Along the way, we found the remains of a rusted steam engine, a large pile of rock tailings, and an old mine shaft. One of the maps indicated a cemetery along the trail but we saw no signs of it. 

Once the trail reached Siskiwit Bay, the trail mostly followed the shoreline around the bay. We took several breaks, including a stop for 15-20 minutes to lounge in the sun on rocks along the shoreline just across Senter Point. We could just make out the Siskiwit Bay dock and campground across the bay.

We continued following the trail along the red sand beach where we saw moose and wolf prints. Eventually the trail left the beach to head slightly inland towards the bridge to cross the Big Siskiwit River.

We made it to camp to find one of the two shelters available. We dropped our packs to claim it while we checked out the other sites. Sites 1-3 are the best, as they offer some limited views of the water, whereas the others are further back in the trees. We decided to stick with the shelter as not needing to pitch our tents would help us pack faster and hit the trail earlier the next morning, which would be our longest day on the trail (10.5 miles). It turned out we made just in time to get the shelter as another group arrived barely 15 minutes after we did.

We ate lunch at the shelter picnic table then headed down to the bay to go for a swim. The water was cold but not unbearable and very refreshing. Our only mistake was swimming to the right of the dock where the bottom was rocky and we had to be careful to avoid slipping. We discovered later that the bottom to the left of the dock was much more sandy. With the sun shining and very little wind, it was perfect swimming weather. It felt great to be able wash off some of the grime from the trail in the cleansing waters of Lake Superior.

Later in the afternoon, I chatted with another group that included hikers from Wisconsin and Washington state. Several picnic tables on the dock were covered with gear and provisions (and booze!), and we wondered when/if someone was going to show up to claim them. Eventually, three boats arrived by evening to anchor at the dock and fire up a grill. 

We all sat down on the dock at dusk to watch for moose and other wildlife, but only heard the occasional loon. Nevertheless, we were able to enjoy a sunset as the light faded and darkness fell over the bay. We were also entertained by listening in the boaters share stories and enjoy their provision, though to their credit they retired to bed like the rest of us by 10 PM.

I woke up at 1:30 AM to head outside and check to see if the Northern Lights were visible, but unfortunately, they were not. Nevertheless, the Milky Way was clearly visible in the clear night sky, along with thousands (millions?) of other stars. It is hard to describe just how many more stars are visible in the complete wildnerness on a night with no moon.

# Day 3



## What Could Go Wrong?

Actually, nothing went wrong. No one was eaten by bears (there are no bears on the island, only wolves). The only minor mishaps were a bit of gear over-packing, some blisters on the trail, and perhaps going a little light on a water carry the last day when the weather shifted from overcast to sunny.
