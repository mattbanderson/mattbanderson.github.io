I gave a talk at the [Dayton Web Developers](http://www.meetup.com/dayton-web-developers/) meetup about interactive mapping with [Leaflet.js](http://www.leafletjs.com).

It was part of a series of "lightning" talks about a variety of topics, including design tips for non-designers, [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and [#startYourShift](https://twitter.com/startYourShift).

Watch the entire session below, or jump to the 26:38 mark for my talk on [Leaflet](www.leafletjs.com):
