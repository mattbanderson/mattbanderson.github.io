# About The Gorge 

The [Red River Gorge Geological Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/dbnf/recreation/recarea/?recid=39458), located in the [Daniel Boone National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/dbnf/) in Kentucky, is known for its rugged  cliffs, natural arches, and abundant recreational opportunities. 

Though the Red River Gorge is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts today, in the 1960s, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a dam on the Red River, which would have flooded the gorge. Congress approved the plans and began to appropriate funding. Wendell Berry wrote a book called [*The Unforeseen Wilderness*](https://archive.org/details/unforeseenwilder0000berr) in which he advocated for preserving the Gorge. After a 20-year battle to preserve the area, the Red River was designated as a [National Wild and Scenic River](https://rivers.gov/river/red) in 1993.

# Planning

In 2024, I did an overnight trip on the [Swift Camp Creek Trail](https://mattbanderson.com/red-river-gorge-swift-camp-creek-trail). After returning home and reading *The Unforeseen Wilderness*, I decided to plan a longer route to see more of what the Gorge had to offer. 

While the Gorge has a number of named hiking trails, including a section of the [Sheltowee Trace](https://sheltoweetrace.org/trail), most of them are point-to-point trails. As I studied maps of the area , my goal was to link up several trails into as close to a loop as I could get. 

I found several guidebooks useful:
* *[Hiking Kentucky's Red River Gorge](https://amzn.to/47QGqy2)* by Sean Patrick Hill
* *[Red River Gorge Trail Guide](https://amzn.to/4oyQF1b)* by Jerrell Goodpaster
* *[Hinterlands](https://amzn.to/3JW2Shk)* by Jerrell Goodpaster

I found the first book to be a good general overview of the area. The latter two books provide a wealth of in-depth knowledge; however, they are independently published and can be difficult to find. I was able to track down copies through my local library's interlibrary loan program, [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/). 

Eventually, I assembled a route that combined multiple trails into a figure-eight loop around the Gorge, with only a couple miles of road walking. The intersection in the middle allowed for resupply, water caching, or shortening of the route.

*Original planned route: ~42 miles*

Since I had done an [overnight on the Swift Camp Creek trail](https://mattbanderson.com/red-river-gorge-swift-camp-creek-trail/) in March 2024, I planned to start with the longer loop around the rest of the Gorge and see how it went. I also knew the number of spur trails I planned to explore would add an indeterminate amount of mileage.

As it turned out, those spurs added quite a bit, plus a few misadventures getting off-trail, and by late afternoon on the first day I was adjusting the route on the fly. The actual route ended up being 37.5 miles:

# Gear

## Going Frameless

Not much new gear for this trip--the big change was removing the hip belt and framesheet from my pack and going frameless. I did quite a few 3-5 mile shakedown/training hikes prior to the trip and felt pretty good about being able to carry ~15 pounds without much issue, but there was always the chance that my shoulders would hate me after ramping up to a full 10-20 mile day on the trail. 

**Big takeaway: going frameless/beltless was a huge success**! 

On my shorter hikes, I really liked having my hips and legs completely free of any restrictions from a belt. It felt rgreat to see that translate completely to an actual trip without any negative side-effects. I did not notice any lack of support and would not hesitate to do it again. 

## GPS Watch Navigation

The one piece of gear I was using for the first time was the [Garmin Epix Pro Gen2](https://amzn.to/46J5pnJ) smartwatch I picked up at a sale around the 4th of July. I loaded my planned route onto the watch as a GPX file and used it as my primary navigation tool.

**Verdict: highly recommend**
