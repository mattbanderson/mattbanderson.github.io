# About The Gorge 

The [Red River Gorge Geological Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/dbnf/recreation/recarea/?recid=39458), located in the [Daniel Boone National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/dbnf/) in Kentucky, is known for its rugged  cliffs, natural arches, and abundant recreational opportunities. 

Though the Red River Gorge is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts today, in the 1960s, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a dam on the Red River, which would have flooded the gorge. Congress approved the plans and began to appropriate funding. Wendell Berry wrote a book called [*The Unforeseen Wilderness*](https://archive.org/details/unforeseenwilder0000berr) in which he advocated for preserving the Gorge. After a 20-year battle to preserve the area, the Red River was designated as a [National Wild and Scenic River](https://rivers.gov/river/red) in 1993.

# Planning

In 2024, I did an overnight trip on the [Swift Camp Creek Trail](https://mattbanderson.com/red-river-gorge-swift-camp-creek-trail). After returning home and reading *The Unforeseen Wilderness*, I decided to plan a longer route to see more of what the Gorge had to offer. 

While the Gorge has a number of named hiking trails, including a section of the [Sheltowee Trace](https://sheltoweetrace.org/trail), most of them are point-to-point trails. As I studied maps of the area , my goal was to link up several trails into as close to a loop as I could get. 

I found several guidebooks useful:
* *[Hiking Kentucky's Red River Gorge](https://amzn.to/47QGqy2)* by Sean Patrick Hill
* *[Red River Gorge Trail Guide](https://amzn.to/4oyQF1b)* by Jerrell Goodpaster
* *[Hinterlands](https://amzn.to/3JW2Shk)* by Jerrell Goodpaster

I found the first book to be a good general overview of the area. The latter two books provide a wealth of in-depth knowledge; however, they are independently published and can be difficult to find. I was able to track down copies through my local library's interlibrary loan program, [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/). 

Eventually, I assembled a route that combined multiple trails into a figure-eight loop around the Gorge, with only a couple miles of road walking. The intersection in the middle allowed for resupply, water caching, or shortening of the route.

*Original planned route: ~42 miles*

Since I had done an [overnight on the Swift Camp Creek trail](https://mattbanderson.com/red-river-gorge-swift-camp-creek-trail/) in March 2024, I planned to start with the longer loop around the rest of the Gorge and see how it went. I also knew the number of spur trails I planned to explore would add an indeterminate amount of mileage.

As it turned out, those spurs added quite a bit, plus a few misadventures getting off-trail, and by late afternoon on the first day I was adjusting the route on the fly. The actual route ended up being 37.5 miles:

# Gear

## Going Frameless

Not much new gear for this trip--the big change was removing the hip belt and framesheet from my pack and going frameless. I did quite a few 3-5 mile shakedown/training hikes prior to the trip and felt pretty good about being able to carry ~15 pounds without much issue, but there was always the chance that my shoulders would hate me after ramping up to a full 10-20 mile day on the trail. 

**Big takeaway: going frameless/beltless was a huge success**! 

On my shorter hikes, I really liked having my hips and legs completely free of any restrictions from a belt. It felt rgreat to see that translate completely to an actual trip without any negative side-effects. I did not notice any lack of support and would not hesitate to do it again. 

## GPS Watch Navigation

The one piece of gear I was using for the first time was the [Garmin Epix Pro Gen2](https://amzn.to/46J5pnJ) smartwatch I picked up at a sale around the 4th of July. I loaded my planned route onto the watch as a GPX file and used it as my primary navigation tool. I set the GPX track as a course to follow. While it wasn't perfect, I was pretty impressed with the level at accuracy at many of the intersections. It did get a little annoyed with me when I started following spur trails that we not part of the route. 

**Verdict: highly recommend**

# Trip Report

## Day 1

Any overnight parking in the Gorge requires a pass, so my trip began at the Pine Ridge Mart, where I bought my 3-day pass. From there, I headed to the Rough Trail/Swift Camp Creek [trailhead parking lot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E86Ge2JREbT1C4u77).

I decided to get the road walk out of the way first. For me, I like getting the least interesting stretch over and done with, although I can certainly see the argument for leaving the road walk for last, since it is easy walking. KY-715 dropped steadily downhill towards the Red River. The crossing is a single-lane bridge with [paved parking lot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u7rWes1qr7cEyJL69) with restrooms on the northeast side.

*Single-lane bridge over Red River*

I quickly found the Douglas Trail. It was a pleasant walk along the river, though a bit eroded in spots. I stopped for lunch right on the river just before the fork for the Eagle Point Buttress Trail.

*Nice spot for lunch (looking downstream)*


After finishing lunch, I loaded up on water for a lengthy dry stretch and got back on the trail. Garmin navigation absolutely nailed the split in the trail to head towards Eagle Point Buttress. My watch chirped that there was a turn, and right in front of me was a fork in the trail. I headed uphill, and away from the river. The trail was mostly easy to follow as it looped around the base of buttress.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/200355527@N06/54924549498/in/album-72177720330324746/" title="PXL_20251020_171036246"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54924549498_0ae9ed016c_c.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="PXL_20251020_171036246"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
*Looking up at Eagle Point Buttress*

The trail then climbed up a steady incline over roots and rocks. Just keep heading up until things level out at the top. From there a followed a spur trail to the left towards the overlook. Definitely do not stop at the first vista! Eventually the trail reaches a large, open promontory with 270-degree views of the Gorge with the Red River below.

*Views from Eagle Point Buttress Overlook*

Had I known how great the overlook would be, I would have waited to eat lunch up at the top! Definitely one of the highlights of the trip!

After enjoying the sunshine, blue sky, and views at the overlook for a bit, I got back on the trail, heading north/northwest to link up with the Osborne Bend Trail. Because it is not an official trail, there are no blazes.

**Be careful on this section. I recommend having a GPS device in addition to a map**. 

The trail is relatively flat, but significant deadfall makes it very easy to lose the trail, which  also gets pretty faint at times. I lost the trail about half a mile in and ended up several hundred feet off trail. Because I had GPS on my watch, I was able to hold a bearing and intersect back up with the trail, but not after wandering around for close to half an hour. I was not particularly concerned since I knew the direction I needed to go thanks to GPS, but if I had only a paper map the situation could have become much more problematic.

*Easier woods walking once on the actual Osborne Bend trail*

Once on the Osborne Bend trail, it became easier to navigate. The Lost Branch trali was a rough stretch of trail. Fortunately it had been so dry I did not have to deal wtth much mud, and I was going steadily downhill, but the descent was steep and rocky enough that I had to pick my way also pretty slowly. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/200355527@N06/54924655350/in/album-72177720330324746/" title="PXL_20251020_191618860"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54924655350_8eb552d7ab_c.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="PXL_20251020_191618860"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
*Making my way downhill on the Lost Branch trail*

I finally reached Gladie Creek around 3:30 PM where I was able to refill my water supply. Unfortunately, my Sawyer Squeeze still was not flowing quite as fast as I would have liked, so each stop to filter water took longer than I would have liked. Still, it was at least a consistent flow, much better than my near-disaster last year in the Dolly Sods. The creek was lovely in the low-angle mid-afternoon sunshine.

I crossed the creek to continue on the trail but managed to almost immediately lose it again. I thought I was following it along the creek, but I must have taken a side trail to the creek itself. Reviewing the map and elevation profile afterwards, it looks like I should have gained some elevation as the trail paralleled Gladie Creek. From where I ended up, there was no clear path uphill to any trail, and the path along the north side of the creek eventually ended as small bluffs rose out the water. After backtracking a bit, finding no obvious fork, and returning to the edge of the creek, I started wondering whether my map was inaccurate and the trail was actually on the south side of the creek. Looking across, there did appear to be a bit of a path, so I crossed the creek and gave it a shot. It quickly petered out. Returning to the map, I knew that Salt Fork would be joining Gladie Creek shortly downstream, which should be an unmistakable landmark. With my feet already wet and the creek shallow and sandy, I waded down the one clear and obvious path: Glade Creek itself.

*Good walking, I guess?*

Fortunately, my route finding skills did not turn out to be completely worthless, and I quickly reached Salt Fork. The next challenge was making sure I actually found the trail on the other side. I paused on the south bank to survey the other side and noticed some large droppings. "Pretty remote spot for dog poop, and dogs probably aren't eating that many berries", I thought to myself, before moving on. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/200355527@N06/54924350731/in/album-72177720330324746/" title="PXL_20251020_201537133"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54924350731_0e1d934605_c.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="PXL_20251020_201537133"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
*Not camping here tonight!*

I saw a large campsite on the north side, checked it out, and quickly found the trail, which was now the Sheltowee Trace with it's white turtle blazes. Looking back where I should have come from, there was clearly a trail, so I definitely missed a turn somewhere upstream.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/200355527@N06/54924350746/in/album-72177720330324746/" title="PXL_20251020_202003569.MP"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54924350746_fa5a79163b_c.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="PXL_20251020_202003569.MP"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
*Where I should have come from*

The Sheltowee started with nice easy walking through rhododendrons and eventually descended deeper into the woods towards the Garrett Branch crossing. Here I encountered more route-finding fun! Even though I was now on a major long-distance trail, the blazes left a lot to be desired. The map showed a roughly 180-degree turn a bit past Garrett Branch; however, being a seasonal stream, it is not clear where exactly it actually is. I began heading uphill on what appeared to be a fairly well-trodden path that almost immediately disappeared. A bit more fumbling in the woods before retracing the path downhill. The turn was a much tighter hairpin than the map indicated right at Garrett Branch, not just past it. After retracing my steps back to the crossing, I was able to find a blaze on the other side and verify that I had found the trail again.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/200355527@N06/54924350756/in/album-72177720330324746/" title="PXL_20251020_204723409"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54924350756_1321d442b7_c.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="PXL_20251020_204723409"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
*Quick hairpin to the left, not straight ahead and uphill*

By this point, I was considering where I was going to camp for the night. I had thought I might make it past the Indian Staircase and Cloud Splitter on the first day, but my misadventures getting off trail had slowed me down a fair amount. I also knew those would be some of the highlights of the trip and did not want to rush through them. The stretch of trail between and beyond them was also dry until I reached the Red River. Klaber Branch would be the last water source until the Red River crossing. I decided if there was a good spot by Klaber Branch I would camp there; otherwise I would load up on water and find a good spot near Indian Staircase.

As it turns out, even though Klaber Branch is shown as a year-round steam on the map, there is not much flow, at least in late fall in a dry year. No campsite either, so after filtering and grabbing an extra liter to carry, I headed on toward Indian Staircase. I reached the base right around the golden hour.

*Views from the top*

There are a number of nice campsites along the trail the follows the gorge rim. I unloaded my gear and took my cook kit to a ledge to make dinner, savor the solitude, and watch the sunset. Despite some wrong turns along the way, day one was in the books, and capped off by beatiful views of the Gorge.
